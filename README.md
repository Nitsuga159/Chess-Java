<br />

#### HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

If you want to see the final result, you can download the JAR execuable "chess.jar" and that's all you have to do, run the file and enjoy ðŸ˜‰

### HOW TO GET SOURCE CODE IN MY OWN PROJECT

You have to initialize a java project in your preferred IDLE (I recommend Eclipse). Now, in your `src` folder put all that my `src` have. Then, put the `pieces-image` folder at the same level with `src` (NOT INSIDE), which containts all images that the program will need.

And done, now you have the source code and you can modify whatever you want.
